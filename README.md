# Genomic-Data-Exploration-Pipeline
This Python pipeline performs genomic data analysis by extracting and manipulating sequences from FASTA, FASTQ, and NCBI Entrez. It calculates GC content, nucleotide counts, complements, transcription, translation, identifies longest sequences, computes quality scores, and visualizes sequence lengths and read quality distributions.
